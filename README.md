# Videosearch-Python
Attempting to set up a separate heroku server for the videosearch project
Current Url: https://secret-shore-54651.herokuapp.com/

Current Problem: ffmpeg isn't included in opencv-python on heroku
Possible Workarounds: rewrite as node server, write custom heroku buildpack, use another package to parse frame by frame from a videofile
